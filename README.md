Ice
===

Ice is a GUI automation library written in C#. Currently, three key frameworks are used. The first is the Windows UI Automation framework, which was released as part of the .NET 3.0 framework. This framework allows automation of all Windows applications that implement UI Automation, which includes Win32, Windows Form, Java SWT (in some cases), and WPF applications. The second framework used is mshtml (mshtml.dll is part of the CLR on Windows). Mshtml is used to automate Internet Explorer applications on Windows.
